## Overview

 This was a really fun challenge; the only thing I had an issue with was sizing the icons.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

The first thing I did was decide how I was going to structure the HTML. After I started with the HTML, I proceeded to the CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use the developer tools in the browser to test potential changes.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I will continue to use developer tools in the browser to test potential changes.
